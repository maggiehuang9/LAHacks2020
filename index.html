	<h3>Tuesday, March 10, 2020 When Madness Descended</h3>
	<h4> Still Alive But Barely Breathin' </h4>
</center>

<p> The day we got the news that UCLA was cancelling class after a full day of class Week 10. But guess what? We still got major stress from Night in the Diner so we still gotta meet in person despite coronavirus. But little does everyone know that we got a secret weapon, our fourth member Father Flynn. Bless this Blender Queeeen.
